Had sucess with importing much of the data but still having trouble with getting the ticker.info data from a given date.

In general I don't think free API's provide daily historical fundermentals data.

Ran some initial random forest regression tests, only dummy tests as the sample size was sub 500 and it just guessed all trades
will loose money => it was right 66% of the time.
I'm now starting to compile all trades from the last 10 years (~150k trades) and will test of random forest before moving onto XGBoost.

For situations where 2 or more trades for the same company are logged currently I group the trades into one and indicate the number of buyer.
I'm considering changing this to leaving them as individuals and indicating that there have been prev trades on the same company.
